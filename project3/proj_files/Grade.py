# Grade.py: Output file testing/grading script
#
# Written by: Juston Moore
# October 9, 2009
#
# This is the script that will be run against your program's output
# files. Put all of your input-file-i's and output-file-i's in the
# same directory and run this script in that directory. It will
# generate some sorted-output-i files that show what the output
# files should contain.
#
# NOTE: DO NOT make your program output files that look like the
# sorted-output files. Your output files should look much more
# random due to the random order of the input files and the token
# holding time you choose. All of the lines in the
# sorted-output files should appear somwehre in your output
# files.
#
# This program processes all input and output files and prints
# all errors it finds.
#
# This script has been tested, but there may be errors. If you
# find any, please email me at yangwang@nmt.edu and I will
# correct them as soon as possible. Having an accurate script
# will be a good thing all around for grading!
